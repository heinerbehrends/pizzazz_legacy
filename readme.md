### Project descripition
Started as an self education project to learn how to build a real time multiplayer web application out of a scrabble like word game that I programmed as a simple command line app for the MIT 6.00 computer science course.
The implementation uses create-react-app as the foundation for the frontend code and node with sockets.io for the backend. Frontend state management is done using the redux pattern and redux-sagas for asynchronous code. The project uses the air bnb rules for style and linting except for the jsx extension rule and a few per file exceptions.
